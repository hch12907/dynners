# The supported methods for configuring those IP addresses are:

#
# Those IP addresses are named (below, "name1" to "name4" are used). The
# names can be whatever you want as long as they are UTF-8, even `[ip."世界"]`
# is perfectly reasonable. However, non-alphanumeric identifiers must be
# surrounded by quotes.
#
# Each of the IP addresses have an internal error flag that is set when the
# method fails (e.g. HTTP client returned status code 500, or the IP obtained
# from an interface failed to match the netmask).

    #            Defaults to "::/0" or "0/0".

    #         external IP address.
    #  - regex: run this regular expression on the HTTP response, the first
    #           capture group will be the IP address.
    #           (NOTE: only available when compiled with the feature "regex")

# Configuration of DDNS services.
#
# Just like IP addresses, the service entries are named.
#
# Within each DDNS entry, the "service" and "ip" option are provided. Multiple
# IP addresses are allowed in those two options, if the first IP address is
# unusable (an error flag is set) then the next one will be attempted.
#
# In the case of dual-stacking (IPv4+IPv6), the first usable IPv4 address and
# the first usable IPv6 address will be used to update the record.
#
# NOTE that some services require you to pre-create DNS records on their own
# website, notably Porkbun (the edit operation will succeed, but no actual
# changes are made). Best to create your A and/or AAAA records before starting
# the daemon.
#
# The configuration options are:
#  - service: the DDNS provider to use.
#  - ip: a list of IPs which are possibly used to update the domains.
#  - domains: a list of domains that is updated using the set of IPs in `ip`.
#
# The other options are provider-dependent, see below.
